###  How to Build an API With Python Flask

Python Flask is a popular framework for building web applications and APIs in Python. It provides developers with a quick and easy way to create RESTful APIs that can be used by other software applications. Flask is lightweight and requires minimal setup, making it a great choice for building small to medium-sized APIs. This makes Flask an ideal choice for developers looking to build robust and scalable APIs in Python. This example will review how to create a simple rest API Flask tutorial.
PrerequisitesPermalink

Before we start, we must ensure that a couple of prerequisites are completed. To follow along and run this tutorial, you will need to:

    Install Python
    Have an IDE to edit your code
    Install Postman so that you can test the endpoint

After all 3 of these prerequisites are completed, we can begin!

To run the app follow the below steps

1. Clone the GIT repository
	git clone https://github.com/KishoreNandhu/Flask-restap-blog.git
2. Change the working directory
	cd Flask-restap-blog
3. Install the Flask module
	pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application
	python app.py
5. Use the Postman to test the restAPI endpoints 

Below are the functions supported in the app
 
1. Get all employees details                  -> http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees             - GET method
